# forest-fire
An implementation of the forest fire cellular automata simulation with a simple SDL powered front-end.

## Forest Fire Simulation Rules

    1) An empty cell turns into a tree with probability p.
    2) A tree ignites with probability f.
    3) A tree will burn if at least one neighbor is burning.
    4) A burning cell turns into an empty cell.
